Hi Charlie,

I received your letter and boy do I have many things to suggest to you! I have been considering what the best activities for me to suggest to you would be, as I know that you have always been a curious and cultured person; and don't you worry, Florence is the right place for that!

You ought to go to Boboli Gardens. You must get pretty tired after all that work so get yourself a sandwich at the local bar and head off to lie in the grass and enjoy the sunshine. The Gardens are full of people walking and chatting and you can have a sit down and enjoy the view on Florence. I think it's the place for you and you would love it; and it will really make you appreciate the city you are in.

You could also go and visit the Medici Palace. That's the place to be to learn all about the Florentine Renaissance Period; It's full of wonderful statues that i'm sure you'll recognise, and it's open in the afternoons, which will be perfect for your schedule.

I hope you appreciate the suggestions I made and I can't wait to bump into you sometime! We could go to Boboli together perhaps?

Let me know; lots of love,
Eugenio
