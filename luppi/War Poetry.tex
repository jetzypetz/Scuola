\section{Isaac Rosenberg}
Visual Artist and painter $\to$ his poems offered very vivid images. VISUAL POETRY

\subsection{August 1914}
Getting the message through is the main purpose of the war poets. Rosenberg wants to ask what is going to be lost in this war?

\textit{Three things hath life:}

\textit{Iron} - the suffering manifest in life; and in war the weapons

\textit{Honey} - the people that are dear to you

\textit{Gold} - precious part of your life associated with youth.

In war the Honey and Gold go and the hard and cold Iron is left.

The trenches in the beautiful ripe fields il like a fair mouth's broken tooth.

\section{The Soldier}
If I die in foreign land, that land becomes a part of England
